# My first webpage
This is a part of my learning from CS50x, an online course from Havard University.

This project is about a movie webpage that I am inspired by Netflix and Imdb websites. As a matter of learning, I tried to apply as many features as possible to test various interface outcomes.

It was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, I also learnt to use Local Storage to interact and exchange data between html files.

I am currently working on a bigger version of this project where I would use a framework (React maybe) and build a complete website.
