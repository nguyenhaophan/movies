# My first webpage
This is a part of my learning from CS50x, an online course from Havard University.

This project is about a movie webpage inspired from Netflix and Imdb websites. As a matter of learning, I tried to apply as many features as possible to test various interface outcomes.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
